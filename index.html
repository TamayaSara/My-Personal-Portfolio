		<p>Computers and their vast diversity have always piqued my curiosity. </p>
		<p>I chose my major to be computer science so that I can pursue my career in </p>
		<p>the world of technology.I've been fascinated by computers and how they're used </p>
		<p>since I was a child. I have always been interested in programming languages and </p>
		<p>and how they work. My fascination with programming languages stemmed primarily </p>
		<p>from the process of logical computation and problem-solving, as well as the fact </p>
		<p>that if there is a problem, there is a workable alternative. </p>
